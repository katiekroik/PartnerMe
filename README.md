### The Idea
I think that sometimes, I struggle to find ideas to work on / contribute to and sometimes I have ideas and don't know where to start. It'd be pretty cool to just have a running sheet to collaborate with other devs on projects. Fill out the table below!

Feel free to add whatever language you code in (Java, Scala, Python - really whatever), the idea, your ID, and if you've found your group! 

Language | Idea | Is Done | Collaborator IDs
--- | --- | --- | --- |
MD | Have a place where devs can find other projects | Y | katiekroik
